In regards of PowerBI, my goal is to become proficient in creating appealing interactive dashboards that facilitate the quick and efficient extraction of insights from huge, sophisticated datasets. In addition to learning more about automation and machine learning techniques, I want to enhance my proficiency with PowerBI data visualisation and analysis. I also want to improve my design thinking and digital storytelling abilities so that I can communicate findings to clients more effectively.
